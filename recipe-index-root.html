Luckily, Jack has given me ample practice over the years. When we first met, he wouldn’t come near a beet, let alone taste one. But with time (and only a little trickery), I’ve gotten him to try and enjoy a host of beet recipes. Just last week, he devoured an entire beet salad at dinner, proclaiming how much he loved it with every bite. So if you’re still on the fence about beets, I get it. Their earthy…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Just look at those beautiful beet greens! So often, vegetable stems, stalks, and tops like beet greens are written off as scraps and tossed in the trash. But why? Radish greens pulse into a beautiful pesto, carrot tops create a zesty chimichurri, and cauliflower cores blend into ultra-creamy soups and sauces. We might not eat these parts of vegetables every day, but they’re certainly not scraps. So let’s talk beet greens! They have a mild, sweet, and earthy flavor, and they take on a delicate, silky texture when cooked. Honestly, I think they’re just as tasty as beets themselves. Try…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This black bean soup recipe is easy and delicious.&nbsp;It calls for pantry ingredients like canned black beans and spices, and the cooking process is largely hands-off. The stove does most of the work for you! Even though it’s simple, this black bean soup has a bold, spicy flavor and creamy texture. The secret ingredient? Bean juice! See, when I cook with canned beans, I almost always start by draining and rinsing them. But in this black bean soup recipe, I use the liquid in the can as well as the beans themselves. This liquid, coupled with the fact that I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you’re ever wondering how to spend a rainy, gray fall day, here’s your answer: make this butternut squash ravioli recipe! It’s a bit of a project, as you’ll make both the pasta and the filling from scratch, but Jack and I can attest that it’s a total blast. Your kitchen will fill with the mouthwatering aroma of roasting squash, shallots, and sage, and you’ll have a chance to get a little crafty as you carefully fill and punch out each piece of butternut squash ravioli. Then comes the best part: you eat! I love to serve my butternut squash…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you’ve never cooked sautéed kale before, now’s the time to try it! It’s a versatile side dish, just as at home alongside a bowl of soup as it is next to a pile of pasta, but it’s also a fantastic cooking component. My recipe calls for 6 ingredients (3 of which are olive oil, salt, and pepper), and it cooks up in under 5 minutes. Because it’s so simple, it’s one of my go-to additions to clear-out-the-fridge frittatas, quick weeknight pastas, improvised grain bowls, and more. As an added bonus, it’s jam-packed with nutrients, and it tastes delicious. Kale…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you like pancakes that are light, fluffy, moist, and flavorful (who doesn’t?!), you’re going to LOVE these almond flour pancakes! I had the idea to make them last spring, when Jack and I were saving our limited supply of regular flour for baking projects like pita, bagels, and no-knead bread. All-purpose flour is easier to come by now, but in our house, these almond flour pancakes are sticking around for good. This almond flour pancake recipe is totally grain and gluten-free, but it’s just as good as any traditional pancake recipe I’ve tried. The pancakes are soft and tender,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you’ve never roasted delicata squash before, get ready to fall in love! When winter squash appears at farmers markets and grocery stores each year, I’m excited to get my hands on all of it – acorn squash, butternut squash, sugar pie pumpkins, and more. But delicata squash is my favorite by far. Nicknamed the “sweet potato squash,” it has a sweet, velvety flesh that caramelizes beautifully in the oven. But that’s not all. Thanks to its small size and thin, edible skin, it’s super easy to work with. That’s right – you don’t have to peel it! In fact,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This pear salad recipe celebrates some of the fall produce that we don’t talk about often enough. For just a moment, we’re all going to forget about apples and squash. This is the season of crisp fennel, tender greens, and sweet, juicy pears that just beg you to eat them. Together, these three fall ingredients create a salad that’s simple, flavorful, and gorgeous. It’s elegant enough for a special occasion meal, but it’s so easy to make that you’ll toss it together for everyday dinners and lunches too. Chopped pecans, walnuts, and hazelnuts add rich, nutty flavor and crunch to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If my Midwestern upbringing taught me one thing, it’s that there’s nothing better than a slice of cornbread and a bowl of chili on a cold fall night. But I’m not talking about just any cornbread. I’m talking about&nbsp;good&nbsp;cornbread, the kind that’s slightly crumbly, perfectly golden, and right on the line between savory and sweet. If you dunk it into the smoky, spicy chili, it’ll taste delicious, but it’s also tasty on its own, with or without a pat of butter on top. This homemade cornbread recipe checks every box. Even Jack, who generally swears off cornbread, is happy eating…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Fall might technically begin on September 22, but in our house, it never really arrives until I make this apple crumble recipe. Of all the apple desserts out there, it’s the one I come back to every year. An oat-y, nutty crumble topping covers a thick layer of warmly spiced fall apples. It’s eons easier than pie, and for my money, it’s just as good. So if you have a surplus of apples from a trip to an orchard, a farmers market, or the store, I hope you try this apple crumble recipe! It takes just over 30 minutes to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you love fall baking but need a break from pumpkin spice, make homemade soft pretzels! Way back in the early years of Love and Lemons, Jack and I shared a vegan soft pretzel recipe that continues to be one of the most popular recipes on the site. A few weeks ago, when we were in the mood for a fun weekend project, we decided to give the old recipe a go. Our homemade pretzels came out pretty well, but we thought we could make them even better.
