In fact, throughout her career, J-Lo has appeared in many popular films, such as the 1997 biopic Selena, The Cell (2000), and Shall We Dance? (2004) and Monster-in-Law (2005). She’s also become one of the highest-grossing Hispanic singers and actresses of all time, with estimated global sales of 80 million records and cumulative film grossing over $3 billion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar50205100.jpg><p>Over the years,<a href=# rel=nofollow> J-Lo has amassed a $400 million net worth</a> and become one of the most influential Hispanic performers of all time. However, she’s also become a well-known diva. The singer and actress has been involved in her fair share of controversies over the years. In fact, not many people who have worked with J-Lo have nice things to say about the pop star. Most recently, Colombian singer Maluma revealed what it was like to work with Jennifer Lopez in the movie Marry Me.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jennifer Lopez's Assistant Quit And Worked For Mariah Carey Instead, Because Of Her Hatred Towards J-Lo's Ex-Casper Smart</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-has-been-involved-in-many-controversies-throughout-her-career>Jennifer Lopez Has Been Involved in Many Controversies Throughout Her Career</h2><p>Like many other successful singers and actors, J.Lo has been involved in numerous controversies over the years. On more than one occasion, the pop icon has feuded with celebrities such as Mariah Carey and Brandy, and it’s even rumored that she fought with Cameron Diaz when they worked together in the movie What to Expect When You're Expecting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar51673520.jpg><p>Plus, plenty of people who have worked with J-Lo have revealed that working with the singer is a total nightmare. For example, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Rosie Perez revealed that J-Lo manipulated their wardrobe and makeup</a> to her advantage when they worked together in InLiving Color. Perez has also admitted that she and the rest of the dancers of the show considered J.Lo a diva for how rude she was to them backstage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>People That Met Jennifer Lopez Seem To Believe She Has A No Eye Contact Rule</a></span></p><p>Most recently, the On the Floor singer received a lot of backlash after making some rather mean comments about having to perform alongside Shakira in the Super Bowl halftime show. In her documentary Halftime, Lopez called this "the worst idea in the world."</p><p>As if this wasn’t enough. J-Lo is known for being rude and entitled toward people working in the service industry. She once <a href=# rel=nofollow>avoided speaking directly to a flight attendant</a> during a whole trip. And many <a href=# rel=nofollow>restaurant workers have revealed that serving J-Lo is a total nightmare</a>, either because she won’t tip fairly or because she’s plain rude to the staff.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maluma-revealed-that-filming-marry-me-alongside-jennifer-lopez-was-a-difficult-experience>Maluma Revealed That Filming Marry Me Alongside Jennifer Lopez Was a Difficult Experience</h2><p>Most recently, Jennifer Lopez, Owen Wilson, and Maluma worked together in Kat Coiro’s romantic comedy and drama Marry Me (2022). Based on Bobby Crosby’s 2012 graphic novel of the same name, the film stars J-Lo as Kat Valdez, a pop star who decides to marry Charlie Gilbert (Wilson), a math teacher holding a "Marry Me" sign at one of her concerts, after learning that her on-stage bridegroom Bastian (Maluma) has been cheating on her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar52239085.jpg><p>In an interview for Hola!, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Maluma revealed that he forgot his lyrics</a> while performing the song “She Got My Back” alongside J-Lo while filming the movie.</p><p>He called this experience a total nightmare but revealed that the pop singer helped him get through it. “We had a teleprompter because I didn’t know the lyrics to the song. And then I started singing and I forgot the lyrics. And I saw the teleprompter, and the teleprompter went off.” Then he explained how J-Lo was there to support him, “She held me, man. She got my back.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jennifer Lopez Reveals Meaning Behind Song 'On My Way' From Her Film 'Marry Me'</a></span></p><p>In addition to filming together, Maluma and J-Lo worked on a soundtrack album for the film.

It was projected to gross $6 to $11 million in the U.S. and Canada alone, it grossed $22.5 million in these two countries and over $28 million in other territories across the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The movie, which was also released on Peacock at the same it hit the theaters, soon became a fan favorite.
