<time>04 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Did you already see Mean Girls musical star Renee Rapp portray another mean girl persona in The Sex Lives of College Girls that premiered on HBO Max lately on 18 November 2021?</p><p>Viewers have loved the up-and-coming talent on this show as she has had perfected her mean-girl chops portraying Regina George in the Broadway musical version of Mean Girls.</p><p>Now that you are aware of her craft to some extent, it’s time you get to know her dating life, net worth, parents, height, and more.</p><h3><strong>Is Reneé Rapp Still Dating Antonio Cipriano?</strong></h3><p>The answer to this is a resounding yes. Reneé Rapp was still dating fellow Broadway star Antonio Cipriano as of the time of this writing.</p><p>Meanwhile, the two could be spotted together on social media until as far as 18 August 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/renee-rapp-dating-net-worth-parents-height-2021-1-300x247.jpg><p>They started dating at least since 2019 and have been Instagramming their moments together from that year on.

All artists deserve to exist fully and authentically”, he had explained.</p><p>Antonio turned 21 on 13 May 2000.</p><h3><strong>Reneé Rapp Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Reneé Rapp was said to have nearly made $500K as her net worth by the time she was playing the wealthy, haughty blonde Leighton in the Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble’s HBO Max comedy.</p><p>Before this, she made her grand entrance onto Broadway’s Minskoff Theatre stage back in June 2018 as queen bee Regina George in Mean Girls; which (of course) happened to her after her success at the competition known to most as the Jimmy Awards.</p><p>Reneé, who opted to move to New York and pursue music over college,&nbsp;also recorded a solo album during 2019’s summer.
