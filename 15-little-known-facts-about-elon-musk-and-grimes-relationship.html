Grimes used to study neuroscience, so she's a good match for Musk, who uses his rare and special brainpower to design electric cars and spaceships. He has also warned humankind about the dangers of artificial intelligence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These two 'spacey" celebs are both drawn to science, and they're also intensely creative. Elon actually recorded music recently, so check out his tune, <a href=#>Don't Doubt uR Vibe</a>, if you want to hear something new, from an unexpected musician.</p><p>What's most interesting about this pair is that they're reportedly going to be parents. Neither of them has come out and said that they're having a baby with the other person, but fans are definitely able to put two and two together.</p><p>Elon and Grimes have been close for a while. Their shared interests and eccentricities keep them going strong, although it hasn't always been smooth sailing.</p><h2 id=she-is-7-months-pregnant><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>She Is 7 Months Pregnant</span></h2><p>Grimes is having a baby. In fact, she's pretty far along in her pregnancy. As of early March 2020, she's at the 7-month mark. She's a bit worried about being a good mom in the future, but that's normal. We are sure this fascinating lady will rock motherhood, just like she rules pop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elon-s-been-cryptic-about-grimes-pregnancy><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Elon's Been Cryptic About Grimes' Pregnancy</span></h2><p>Grimes has been discussing her pregnancy a lot. She's not keeping it a secret, although she doesn't talk about whether Elon contributed to her growing baby bump. Still, it's a pretty safe bet that Elon is the father of her unborn child. He posted a cryptic tweet, "x is y", and fans believe that he's referring to the baby.</p><p>Grimes has been sleepy lately. She wants to sleep, wake up, and then sleep again. She's also been dealing with rosacea, according to Pagesix.com. This skin condition has apparently been triggered by her pregnancy.</p><p>Grimes' openness about her pregnancy is endearing. It makes her more relatable, although she's hardly the girl next door, and we don't want her to ever be that. We doubt Elon does, either.</p><h2 id=social-media-users-are-loving-the-pregnancy><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Social Media Users Are Loving The Pregnancy</span></h2><p>If you love reading what people have to say on Twitter, you'll enjoy all of the commentary related to Grimes, Elon Musk, and the unborn baby. There are some very entertaining posts about this subject. One fan knew Grimes from way back when, and compared Grimes' life to her own, with hilarious results.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other posts talk about an eventual battle for world domination, between Grimes' and Elon's baby and Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner's baby.</p><h2 id=grimes-has-been-open-about-expecting-a-baby><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Grimes Has Been Open About Expecting A Baby</span></h2><p>Grimes has an edgy image, but she can be very down to earth. She doesn't hesitate to share her thoughts about her pregnancy with fans. She's actually quite jolly and sweet when she does video chats online and stuff like that.</p><p>Grimes is more than her sci-fi image. She's a 31-year-old woman who is full of life. She says she's going to let her baby decide on its identity, free of gender stereotypes and roles, so she's going to be an ultra-modern mother.</p><h2 id=elon-and-grimes-are-dealing-with-the-amber-heard-scandal><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Elon And Grimes Are Dealing With The Amber Heard Scandal</span></h2><p>Do you think Grimes is jealous of Amber Heard? Elon confessed to being totally crushed when his romance with heartbreaker Amber ended. He was clearly bewitched by Amber Heard. There are rumors he had an affair with her while she was still married to Johnny Depp. In fact, Johnny has stated this himself, according to Pagesix.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maybe Grimes is too secure to worry about Amber. Grimes has her own thing going on, besides being someone's partner. A lot of people consider Grimes a groundbreaking genius, just like Elon. We think Grimes is awesome on her own, whether she has a partner or not. But the whole situation with Amber and Elon, plus the lawsuit between Johnny and Amber, may stress her out occasionally.</p><h2 id=grimes-has-been-encountering-pregnancy-symptoms><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Grimes Has Been Encountering Pregnancy Symptoms</span></h2><p>As mentioned, Grimes is toughing it out as she deals with fatigue and skin irritation. She's experiencing annoying pregnancy symptoms, just like most women do. It's a rite of passage that a lot of women go through, and it passes. Soon enough, Grimes will have a beautiful baby to love. She has so much charm and intelligence to share with a child.</p><h2 id=grimes-worries-about-whether-she-ll-be-a-good-mom><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Grimes Worries About Whether She'll Be A Good Mom</span></h2><p>As noted, Grimes wonders what kind of mom she'll be, and it's normal to worry about whether you'll be a good mother when you're pregnant. It's just human nature. Worrying is actually a good sign because it means that you really care.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Grimes has the confidence to make inventive music and rock a truly iconic image, she's surely got the confidence to get past her pregnancy fears.</p><h2 id=elon-is-a-major-workaholic><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Elon Is A Major Workaholic</span></h2><p>One issue that may impact Grimes' life in the future, when she's a mom, is the fact that alleged baby daddy, Elon Musk, is a total workaholic. This guy has slept on the assembly line at Tesla, rather than going home to his own bed. His work ethic is extreme.</p><p>In fact, some Tesla and SpaceX employees have complained that they are expected to mimic his own crazy work ethic - they work themselves into the ground, according to Cnbc.com.</p><p>Will Grimes' need to do most of the baby care because Elon can't tear himself away from his companies? Time will tell.</p><p class=article-title><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Surprising Facts About Elon Musk's Future Baby Mama, Grimes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elon-dated-grimes-right-after-his-split-from-amber-heard><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Elon Dated Grimes Right After His Split From Amber Heard</span></h2><p>While Grimes might technically be considered the rebound, she and Elon have been together for a long time. Usually, a rebound type of situation won't last. So, regardless of how their relationship started, these two seem to have the compatibility to make things work. Maybe Grimes has way more in common with Elon than Amber Heard did.</p><h2 id=elon-already-has-kids><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Elon Already Has Kids</span></h2><p>Elon isn't new to the whole daddy thing. He already has kids. Elon is no stranger to the whole marriage and baby carriage thing! He's actually an old hand. He has five children and their names are Xavier, Nevada, Damian, Kai, Saxon, and Griffin, according to En.wikipedia.org. If he keeps going, maybe he'll create some huge, Duggar-style family.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Things Tesla's Elon Musk Has Done In 2019 (And 5 He'll Do In 2020)</a></span></p><h2 id=will-elon-and-grimes-marry><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Will Elon And Grimes Marry?</span></h2><p>How traditional is Grimes, really? She certainly seems like someone who would reject old-fashioned values, such as the value of getting married in a white dress, but maybe she does want a white wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of Grimes' fans think Elon is wrong for her. They don't like his politics, his "rich guy" vibe, and the way he won't let his staff unionize, according to The Atlantic. Grimes' politics are far more egalitarian. It's hard to say if these two will walk down the aisle.</p><p>They have plenty of common ground intellectually, but big differences when it comes to politics and values.</p><p class=article-title><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Opposites Attract: 18 Twitter Reactions To Elon Musk And Grimes Dating</a></span></p><h2 id=elon-s-been-making-music><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Elon's Been Making Music</span></h2><p>During the intro to this article, we mentioned that Elon recorded a song, Don't Doubt uR Vibe. Some people like it and some people don't. There's nothing wrong with Elon expressing himself musically. Grimes probably inspires him to do just that. She's an amazing musician who also produces her own work.</p><p>We don't know how Elon finds the time to make music while juggling so many work responsibilities, but he's anything but average, so maybe we shouldn't be surprised that he finds the energy to perform his own music, on top of running great big companies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Crazy Things Elon Musk Is Planning For Tesla’s Future</a></span></p><h2 id=grimes-just-debuted-her-digital-body><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Grimes Just Debuted Her Digital Body</span></h2><p>The haunting and elfin face of Grimes, along with her petite body, has now been made into an avatar. This avatar will function as her "digital body" during her pregnancy, according to Jezebel.com.</p><p>Grimes, who was born Claire Boucher in Canada, can continue to work, using her digital body to share her songs and market her material. This will be helpful during the last months of her pregnancy...and while she's adjusting to being a new mother.</p><p>The name of the digital body is WarNymph.</p><h2 id=elon-has-had-troubled-relationships-here-s-one-ex-wife><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Elon Has Had Troubled Relationships (Here's One Ex-Wife)</span></h2><p>Elon's first wife, Justine, considers herself a "starter wife". She seems a little bit bitter and has been milking her connection to the Tesla titan for some time. She's a classic beauty, just like Amber Heard and Elon's second wife (they are now divorced), Tallulah Riley. Grimes is a little more offbeat, but still really pretty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elon has a type, but he moves on when he wants to. Plenty of women fit his type, it seems. He's had some troubled relationships.</p><h2 id=grimes-doesn-t-want-to-spoil-her-child><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Grimes Doesn't Want To Spoil Her Child</span></h2><p>The lovely and gifted Grimes is thinking about what kind of mother she wants to be. She thinks that spoiling her child will be a mistake and she may have a point. When kids get spoiled, they take things for granted, from money to love and beyond. Grimes wants her child to grow up doing chores to stay grounded.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Women Elon Musk Dated (And 10 Rules He Made Them Follow)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobmWcnsG1uMRmoqenp6N6p63CrapmmZKkwrV5xKWmp2WdqsCsecCnm2afop66pr%2BMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-little-known-facts-about-elon-musk-and-grimes-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f15-little-known-facts-about-elon-musk-and-grimes-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f15-little-known-facts-about-elon-musk-and-grimes-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f15-little-known-facts-about-elon-musk-and-grimes-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-little-known-facts-about-elon-musk-and-grimes-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-little-known-facts-about-elon-musk-and-grimes-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./daniil-medvedev-wife-medvedev-married-daria.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./daniil-medvedev-wife-medvedev-married-daria.html>Daniil Medvedev Wife: Is Daniil Medvedev married to Daria?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./travis-kelces-brother-jason-kelce-addresses-taylor-swift-dating-rumors-girls-night-new-york-blake-lively.html>Travis Kelces Brother Addresses Taylor Swift Dating Rumors As Shes Spotted On A Girls Night</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./travis-kelces-brother-jason-kelce-addresses-taylor-swift-dating-rumors-girls-night-new-york-blake-lively.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
