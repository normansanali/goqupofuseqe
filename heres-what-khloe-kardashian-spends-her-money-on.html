As we’ll see throughout the article, her recent spending habits have a lot to do with daughter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">True</a>. She’s pretty darn spoiled, with a playhouse worth more than some of our cars, not to mention a toy Bentley ride which in truth (no pun intended), looks better than most of our cars! Despite the spending habits on her daughter, as we’ll see throughout the entries, she isn’t apologetic about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We’ll take a look at her other spending habits, some more expensive than others, like her beautiful home worth over $7 million, along with one luxurious Rolls Royce SUV.

Fans took exception&nbsp;to her ways, spoiling her daughter on the norm. However, Khloe wasn’t having it, defending the fact that it doesn’t change True’s values, even if she has a near $13,000 playhouse in her backyard, one similar to Kylie’s;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Yes, I do choose to spoil my daughter. I want to spoil her with love as well with material items. She will also be raised with values, responsibilities, chores, respect, self-love. We all work hard and we are able to spend our money in the way that we choose. I hope that's what comes across to 'the outside world', To lead with love above anything else."</p><h2 id=true-s-toy-bentley><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>True’s Toy Bentley</span></h2><p>We know this was an expensive purchase when even the likes of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd Mayweather</a>, who is close to billionaire status bought one for his kid. Once again, Khloe had to face the wrath of certain fans for her spending habits – this time though, she clapped back against a negative comment on IG, here’s what she had to say;</p><p>“Ummm you know this is not a real Bentley? It’s a toy. No reason to be sad over a baby in a toy car. Either way I’m sorry you feel that way but I hope you have a great weekend! Focus on things that make you happy!

Khloe was seen in the ride leaving a filming studio over in Agoura Hills, California. It was a heart-racing moment for both her and the fans, as she struggled to get out of the parking lot, nearly crashing the new ride.
