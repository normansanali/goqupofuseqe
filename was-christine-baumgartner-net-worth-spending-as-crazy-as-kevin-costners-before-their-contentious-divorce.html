"Christine allocates 60 percent of expenses such as private trainer, unallocated credit card expenses, and her plastic surgery to the minor children without any explanation or basis."</p><p>Costner wrote in court documents obtained by US Weekly. "The children do not use the services of private trainers, only Christine does.

This is because I am no longer under contract for Yellowstone, the principal source of my income last year. The fixed amount ‘pay or play’ and episodic compensation I received has ceased.
