He has released a total of twenty mixtapes and two studio albums so far.&nbsp;The second album titled Jungle Rules was released in July 2017, with its lead single being the hit track “Unforgettable” which features Swae Lee.</span></p><h2><strong><span>ethnicity</span></strong></h2><p><span>The French Montana is a naturalized US citizen but an ethnic Moroccan with possible ties to Somalia through his mother who reportedly has a relative from there.&nbsp;In the general sense, Montana can also be considered a black man as he is ultimately from Africa.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Parents &&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Brother</span></strong></h2><p><span>As stated above, French Montana’s parents are Khadija Guled and Abdela Kharbouch.&nbsp;From his late teens, Montana only had the pleasure of his mother’s company as his father chose to return to Morocco after failing to find his feet in the United States.&nbsp;The couple reunited, however, in 2012 when Montana returned home for the first time in 14 years.</span></p><p><span>French Montana has two brothers;&nbsp;Zack and Ayoub Kharbouch.&nbsp;Ayoub is currently finishing high school while Zack is president of Coke Boys Records.</span></p><h2><strong><span>French Montana’s&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Wife and Son</span></strong></h2><p><span>French Montana was previously married to DeenKharbouch.&nbsp;The couple married in 2007 but did not separate until five years later in 2012 following accusations that they had been abandoned by their Montana family because of their work.&nbsp;They finalized their divorce in 2014.</span></p><p><span>Together, the couple share a son named Kruz Kharbouch who was born in 2010.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height, weight and other facts</span></strong></h2><p><strong><span>Birth name:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Karim Kharbouch</span></p><p><strong><span>Stage Name:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;French Montana</span></p><p><strong><span>Date of birth:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;November 9, 1984</span></p><p><strong><span>Place of birth:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Rabat, Morocco</span></p><p><strong><span>Occupation:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Rapper</span></p><p><strong><span>Height:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;6 feet 3 inches</span></p><p><strong><span>Weight:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;89kg</span></p><p><strong><span>Zodiac sign:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Scorpio</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGieopq7pLSMpqanrJGjrm60xKKeoaxdlrSmedKopWavmZuybq7RqKuhnaJivaK%2BxKerrGWVqbWvtcKiq7Jn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrench-montana-height-age-son-wife-brother-parents-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffrench-montana-height-age-son-wife-brother-parents-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffrench-montana-height-age-son-wife-brother-parents-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffrench-montana-height-age-son-wife-brother-parents-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrench-montana-height-age-son-wife-brother-parents-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrench-montana-height-age-son-wife-brother-parents-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-old-are-leslie-jordan-silblings-meet-twin-sisters-jana-and-janet-partner-of-openly-gay-actor.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-old-are-leslie-jordan-silblings-meet-twin-sisters-jana-and-janet-partner-of-openly-gay-actor.html>How Old Are Leslie Jordan Silblings?
