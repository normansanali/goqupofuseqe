According to our research, no information on the internet regarding his current love life is available.</p><p>He is not married, and neither is he in a relationship now. <span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family)>It’s possible that he withheld that information for security or private reasons.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family)>He has not mentioned anything regarding his relationship.</span></p><p>These are only speculations based on the confidentiality of his life; perhaps he is not married and prioritizes his profession over his romantic life for now.</p><p>Katie Smith, who is known to her fans as “KT,” reportedly started dating him sometime in 2017.</p><p>Although the musician admits that being a single parent “is definitely not how I imagined parenthood,” he is embracing his new position for the young son who is “happy,” “healthy,” and “incredible.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=relationship-with-his-baby-mama-katie-smith></span>Relationship With His Baby Mama Katie Smith<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wallen and Smith have a son named Indigo Wilder in July 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though they had just welcomed a brand-new bundle of joy into the world, the joyful parents were very clear that they weren’t exactly doing it together.&nbsp;</p><p>Without once mentioning Wallen, Smith wrote in an Instagram post, “Yesterday was nothing short of complete bliss… Indie Wilder, you are your mama’s answered prayer times infinity and the cutest little human ham hunk I’ve ever seen.”&nbsp;</p><p>Wallen, meanwhile, wrote his own joyous post and swore to be the co-parent his son’s mother and boy both deserved. He placed a lot of stress on the word “co-parent.”</p><p>However, why did the couple part ways in the first place? Smith claims that the couple’s previous relationship was toxic rather than just bad.</p><p>KT Smith mentioned that Morgan Wallen wasn’t the most faithful.&nbsp;</p><p>Smith claims that her Instagram following skyrocketed once word spread that she was the mother of country singer Morgan Wallen’s child.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=more-details-on-their-relationship></span>More Details On Their Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>But the true drama began when she entered the “Up Down” of her “toxic” relationship with Wallen. The couple allegedly met on Snapchat, fell in love immediately, and were engaged just a few months later.&nbsp;</p><p>They eventually ended their engagement but stayed together for three more years while dating for another two. However, the third year was difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>The kind of trauma-filled, toxic attachment you see on TikTok,” she admitted. <span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family)>Morgan Wallen and KT Smith are dedicated to co-parenting their son.</span></p><p><span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family)>Thankfully, the poisonous relationship has ended, and the famous co-parents’ relationship with their son is only improving.</span></p><p>Because God always forgives and because He is a good father, Morgan is truly and deeply a lovely person who also makes mistakes that can be forgiven, she wrote.</p><p>We wish these two the best of luck in their future co-parenting endeavors!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWfp7SiuoywmKWklaN6uLXFnmSiq12dsm65wKupop2UYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnWoquhZZiewG6uwJuwppmdlnqsrdOinGarnZ7BqXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmorgan-wallen-wife-is-he-married-relationship-with-his-babymama-katie-smith.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmorgan-wallen-wife-is-he-married-relationship-with-his-babymama-katie-smith.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmorgan-wallen-wife-is-he-married-relationship-with-his-babymama-katie-smith.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmorgan-wallen-wife-is-he-married-relationship-with-his-babymama-katie-smith.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmorgan-wallen-wife-is-he-married-relationship-with-his-babymama-katie-smith.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmorgan-wallen-wife-is-he-married-relationship-with-his-babymama-katie-smith.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./most-disastrous-dancing-with-the-stars-partners-ever-w437572.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./most-disastrous-dancing-with-the-stars-partners-ever-w437572.html>Most Disastrous 'Dancing With the Stars' Partners Ever!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./michael-eisner-net-worth-2024.html>Michael Eisner Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./michael-eisner-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
