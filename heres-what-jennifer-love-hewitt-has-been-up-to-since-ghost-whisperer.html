Her series,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost Whisperer</a>, was a huge hit, and since then, she has remained quite busy.</p><p>Let’s look and see what Jennifer Love Hewitt has been up to!</p><h2 id=she-s-currently-starring-on-9-1-1>She’s Currently Starring On 9-1-1</h2><p>Jennifer Love Hewitt has found sustained success on the small screen through the years, and even after her time on&nbsp;Ghost Whisperer came to an end, the performer was still able to find television success. In recent years, the performer has been featured on the series&nbsp;9-1-1.</p><p>Unlike&nbsp;Ghost Whisperer, Hewitt was not involved in the inaugural season of&nbsp;9-1-1, but the series brought her into the fold in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">second season</a> and has kept her on board ever since. Even though there was a stellar cast in place, the folks behind the scenes made the decision to bring in Hewitt and add even more star power to the production, which got people even more interested in what was going on each week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show is currently in the midst of its fourth season, and it appears to be back and better than ever. At this time, there is no word about a fifth season coming into play, but if the show is able to keep up the success that it found, then there is no reason why the network would consider bringing it to an end.</p><p>Aside from the primary&nbsp;9-1-1 being a hit, the show was successful enough to spawn a spin-off series,&nbsp;9-1-1:&nbsp;Lone Star. That show, which stars Rob Lowe, has also been a success, proving that the franchise itself has a core audience, not unlike&nbsp;CSI or&nbsp;Law & Order.</p><p>9-1-1 is the biggest project that Hewitt has worked on in recent years, but this does not mean that it is the only project that she has been working on. While she is best known for what she has done in front of the camera, Hewitt has stepped behind the camera and has gotten her hands dirty behind the scenes since Ghost Whisperer came to an end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is Why Ethan Embry Doesn’t Remember Starring In ‘Can’t Hardly Wait’</a></span></p><h2 id=she-got-into-directing-and-producing>She&nbsp;Got Into Directing And Producing</h2><p>Many actors find themselves wanting to do more than just work in front of the cameras, and eventually, they will shift into producing and directing projects. This is precisely what Jennifer Love Hewitt has done over the years, stacking up some impressive credits along the way.</p><p>Interestingly, her time as a director actually started while she was still on&nbsp;Ghost Whisperer. She ended up directing 3 episodes of the show from 2009 to 2010, getting some valuable experience on a show that she was the star of. Since then, she has moved on and done some additional directing. From 2012 to 2013, Hewitt directed three episodes of&nbsp;The Client List.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of getting directing credits, Hewitt has also been doing work as a producer. Her time producing precedes her time on&nbsp;Ghost Whisperer, but she has continued to get producing credits since the show came to an end. According to&nbsp;IMDb, the star has producing credits for&nbsp;The Client List and for&nbsp;Jewtopia in recent years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Serial Daters In Hollywood Who Have Dated Over 5 Different Celebs</a></span></p><h2 id=she-was-featured-on-criminal-minds>She Was Featured On Criminal Minds</h2><p>Even though Hewitt is primarily known for her starring roles on television, this does not mean that she is opposed to taking secondary roles on other projects. In fact, ever since&nbsp;Ghost Whisperer ended, the performer has taken to secondary work on some popular television shows.</p><p>For perhaps her biggest recurring role, Hewitt was part of the main cast of season 10 of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Criminal Minds</a>. This was a nice surprise for fans, and it was great to see her have a recurring character on the series back in 2014. Her role on&nbsp;Criminal Minds came on the heels of her starring on&nbsp;The Client List, which ran for two seasons and a total of 25 episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;IMDb, some of Hewitt’s other appearances include&nbsp;Love Bites, Hot in Cleveland,&nbsp;and she even had guest judging duties on&nbsp;RuPaul’s Drag Race. Her work on the big screen has been far less prolific, as she has only been in two projects in film since 2011.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 10 Most Famous Women John Mayer Has Dated</a></span></p><p>Ghost Whisperer was a huge success for Jennifer Love Hewitt, and she has remained quite active since the show came to an end.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Actresses Who Have Played Princess Diana In TV And Movies</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKOdnqO2p7HRZqOorpVitabDyK2rZqCRqHqjscSnZK6oXam8br%2FIp5qeZZedvLTAjLCfoqugmr%2Bmvo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-what-jennifer-love-hewitt-has-been-up-to-since-ghost-whisperer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-what-jennifer-love-hewitt-has-been-up-to-since-ghost-whisperer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-what-jennifer-love-hewitt-has-been-up-to-since-ghost-whisperer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-what-jennifer-love-hewitt-has-been-up-to-since-ghost-whisperer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-what-jennifer-love-hewitt-has-been-up-to-since-ghost-whisperer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-what-jennifer-love-hewitt-has-been-up-to-since-ghost-whisperer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hp-chromebook-11-with-lte-arrives-at-best-buy-altairs-lte-modem-inside.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hp-chromebook-11-with-lte-arrives-at-best-buy-altairs-lte-modem-inside.html>HP Chromebook 11 with LTE Arrives at Best Buy, Altair's LTE Modem Inside</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gen-v-recap-season-one-episode-4-the-whole-truth-html.html>Gen V Recap: A Small Man Playing Hero</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gen-v-recap-season-one-episode-4-the-whole-truth-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
