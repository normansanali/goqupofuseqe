But whoever was in charge of the guest list for my father’s funeral, shame on you. There were people there who I’ve never seen in my entire life.”</p><p>He continued, “There were people filming us on their iPhones documenting our grief.”</p><p>Prior to his father’s death, Marston said Hugh had gotten “really sick,” which led to Crystal taking some allegedly questionable actions.</p><p>“That’s why she got all these NDA things,” Marston recalled. “According to her, she didn’t want people to see him not able to walk, not able to talk.”</p><p>As Hugh struggled with severe back pain, Marston said his father was “dosed with f–king medication.” He compared Hugh’s situation to the relationship between <strong>Michael Jackson</strong> and his doctor <strong>Conrad Murray</strong>, who was <a href=#>found guilty</a> of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson’s death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Marston-Hefner-Calls-Crystal-Hefner-a-Manipulator-Changed-Hugh-s-Hefner-s-Will-in-Final-Days-.jpg><p>“People can’t say no to these people,” he explained. “They didn’t say no, so they f–kin’ doped him up whenever he wanted to get doped up. He wasn’t here. He was so doped up he didn’t know what was going on.”</p><p>Marston further alleged that Crystal used his father’s fragile mental state to oversee changes to his will, ensuring she received more money after his death. He questioned, “If you’re trying to protect your husband, would you let him dramatically change his finances when he’s not there?”</p><p>In Crystal’s new book, <i>Only Say Good Things: Surviving Playboy and Finding Myself</i>, she claimed otherwise, writing that Hugh left her nothing.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But Marston doesn’t buy it.</p><p>“It’s so bizarre,” he said. “Because it would be easy to say, ‘Thanks, Hugh Hefner, for helping me build this amazing life that I have.’”</p><p>Us Weekly has reached out to Crystal’s reps for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKowbC6jKGcn6aVp3qkrculqmaboq7Ata3LZp%2Benp6av26tjKaYrKyVp3qurc2ip66kkam8s3s%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarston-hefner-calls-crystal-hefner-a-master-manipulator.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmarston-hefner-calls-crystal-hefner-a-master-manipulator.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmarston-hefner-calls-crystal-hefner-a-master-manipulator.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmarston-hefner-calls-crystal-hefner-a-master-manipulator.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarston-hefner-calls-crystal-hefner-a-master-manipulator.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarston-hefner-calls-crystal-hefner-a-master-manipulator.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./myles-murdock-obituary-ontario-mayor-of-goderich-has-died.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./myles-murdock-obituary-ontario-mayor-of-goderich-has-died.html>Myles Murdock Obituary Ontario, Mayor Of Goderich Has Died</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kaila-novak-2.html>Kaila Novak Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kaila-novak-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
