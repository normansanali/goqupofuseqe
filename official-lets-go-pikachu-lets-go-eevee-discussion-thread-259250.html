Yes, this game is still very similar to Pokemon Go, with Pokemon in the overworld, the fact that we only catch wild Pokemon, and its CPs apparently, not levels (which I did not notice yesterday). While I personally would rather have wild encounters that you fight, and have levels (as most people want), I can see why they did this. And, while we haven't seen much about these games yet, we o know that it does look like there are still battles, and likely gyms. It has features that make a core series game, a core series game. (yes, I am on the boat that this is some sort of spin-off game).</p><p>For those who have been still playing Pokemn Go, or at least keeping up with the news, would know that the games are putting out newer generations, they just leave a lot of time in between. Currently, Pokemon up through Gen 3 are catchable (and Alolan forms are in the process of being released for this summer I guess). If these fans haven't been playing the main games since Gen 1, or never played them at all, they have been meeting new Pokemon, and likely are enjoying having more Pokemon to catch (i mean they are still playing the game at least). So, they play Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee, and the have a fun time with the games, because they get to play Pokemon Go mechanics, but also might feel this sense of longing for newer Pokemon. This might give them the inspiration to go pick up a core series game and play it. And/or they here about how the Switch will be having a new Pokemon game next year, that is supposed to be much bigger. This game will bring people into the franchise in a new way.</p><p>I do think it's also important to note that these games at least look like they are running on a very similar engine as XY and ORAS were (the models look very similar for everyting), even though SM and USUM's engine looks way better. To me this puts up the "we did this so we could put less time into producing these games/cheaper to make games" flag. Meaning, more of their attention is going to the game coming out in 2019, and this is really just a game to make a little extra money for the company, and get some new fans.</p><p>All that being said, there are many changes they have made, that I don't want to see stay. I think I'm okay with using the joycons like that to catch a Pokemon, but I want to be able to battle these wild Pokemon too. Give me back that level system, and random encounters in the grass. But, the co-op honestly looks really cool. I can actually see this game being GFs way to test out this co-op mode, and e might actually be seeing one in the future game, which would be so cool.</p><p>Yes, I will buy at least one version of this game, and give it a run through. Will it be everything I ever wanted on a switch Pokemon game? No. But I know that GF has the awesome games coming next year. They are taking their time with those games, and i think they are going to be awesome. So for now, I'll take these cutesy, weird games over nothing at all until then.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHywssWimqKZnGK5psDSZp6oZaCeuKKvx65kpZ2kqHqou4yenK%2BdlWKxqr%2FCrqqsoZ%2BjerW00Z6YnWZiaoZzgY9o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fofficial-lets-go-pikachu-lets-go-eevee-discussion-thread-259250.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fofficial-lets-go-pikachu-lets-go-eevee-discussion-thread-259250.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fofficial-lets-go-pikachu-lets-go-eevee-discussion-thread-259250.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fofficial-lets-go-pikachu-lets-go-eevee-discussion-thread-259250.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fofficial-lets-go-pikachu-lets-go-eevee-discussion-thread-259250.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fofficial-lets-go-pikachu-lets-go-eevee-discussion-thread-259250.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sierra-jenkins-a-reporter-was-killed-in-norfolk-restaurant-shooting.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sierra-jenkins-a-reporter-was-killed-in-norfolk-restaurant-shooting.html>Sierra Jenkins A Reporter Was Killed In Norfolk Restaurant Shooting</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nina-li-chi-net-worth-63820.html>Nina Li Chi Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nina-li-chi-net-worth-63820.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
