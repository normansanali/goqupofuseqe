The actor never married nor had children, but he did have a number of <a class=hm-link href=#>high-profile relationships with fellow famous actors</a> and had been engaged twice in his life.</p><p id=e-HFvs6oPBw data-wc=59>His first engagement was with Mean Girls star Lizzy Caplan. The pair were together in total for six years but called time on their relationship – and engagement – in 2012. In more recent years, Matthew got engaged to his girlfriend <a class=hm-link href=#>Molly Hurwitz</a> in November 2020, a year after they began dating. In 2021, however, the couple parted ways.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27b896c48142-lizzy-caplan-matthew-perry.jpg><p id=eMKE-5WJmD data-wc=34>Molly reacted to her former fiancé's death, writing in part: "No one in my adult life has influenced me more deeply than Matthew Langford Perry. I'm profoundly grateful for everything our relationship taught me."</p><p id=eeKDla18txD data-wc=42>Elsewhere in Matthew's family, he had a close bond with his parents. His mother, <a class=hm-link href=#>Suzanne Marie Morrison</a>, raised him mostly by herself in Canada. She previously worked as a journalist and was the former press secretary to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d829d0271698-matthew-perry-mom-suzanne-sister-emily.jpg><p id=emRCEYQEmhD data-wc=50>Matthew's dad is actor <a class=hm-link href=#>John Bennet Perry</a> – who even had a cameo in Friends – but he and Suzanne split when Matthew was one year old. Suzanne would go on to marry <a class=hm-link href=#>Dateline host Keith Morrison</a>. Keith and Matthew formed a close bond over the years.</p><p id=eYweRKlNx3B data-wc=23>Matthew has four half-siblings on his mother's side: Caitlin, Emily, Will and Madeline.

"As a mother, do you think you're strict?" Kevin asked the actress, to which she immediately responded: "No!"</p><p id=ef2S1PRL23n data-wc=43>"Do you think you're not strict enough?" he probed. "Yes, I'm not strict enough," Courteney replied. "I'm way too understanding of the fact I would probably have done the same thing, I don't keep my boundaries like I should and that's the problem."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c1bcee6ad270-gettyimages-470500140.jpg><h2>Jennifer Aniston</h2><p id=elvPkbW5zK7 data-wc=54>Jennifer, who played the funny and oh-so-slightly spoilt Rachel in Friends, lives in Beverley Hills and often spends evenings with her former co-stars Courteney and Lisa. Jennifer is thought to be single currently, however, she has been married twice and remains on friendly terms with both of her ex-husbands, Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux.</p><p id=eG89EzU36qxy data-wc=61>The star admitted to Elle in 2018 that she hadn't ruled out motherhood or finding love again. Jennifer said: "Who knows what the future holds in terms of a child and a partnership – how that child comes in… or doesn't? And now with science and miracles, we can do things at different times than we used to be able to."</p><p id=ec_Dv9jlYIOc data-wc=42>The actress is kept company by her dogs, Schnauzer mix Clyde and Pitbull Sophie, who she shares with ex-husband Justin. The former couple also had another pooch, Dolly Parton, who sadly passed away in 2019. Jennifer has a dog named Lord Chesterfield.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5fcb718b1e22-screen-shot-2023-08-24-at-114312-am.png><h2>Lisa Kudrow</h2><p id=ew8CW16OLAQL data-wc=31>Lisa was the loveable kooky character Phoebe in&nbsp;Friends and like her former co-stars Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox, also lives in Los Angeles – Lisa's home is in Beverley Hills.</p><p id=e5mhAknUL7FC data-wc=21>The star has been married to French advertising executive Michael Stern since 1995 and the couple have a son, 25-year-old Julian.&nbsp;</p><p id=eOsc0fD_JN data-wc=15><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Lisa Kudrow's rarely-seen husband of 30 years Michael Stern is secretly her biggest fan</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e0wogav2jC data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Jennifer Aniston celebrates Lisa Kudrow's 60th birthday with sweet tribute - and shares unusual nickname</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1f1d83a9ac8f-lisa-kudrow-and-husband-michael-stern.jpg><p id=e3sZKhSX4OZ data-wc=23>Fun fact: Lisa's pregnancy was actually written into season four of Friends when Phoebe was pregnant with her brother's triplets as a surrogate.</p><p id=eQZR9YXGlIHw data-wc=34>The actress previously told Page Six of her son: "[Julian] made it clear from the moment he could speak that he didn't want a brother or sister.

Away from the cameras, the actor was previously in a relationship with TV producer Aurora Mulligan, who he met on the set of Top Gear. Aurora is believed to be 17 years younger than Matt and was born in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. In 2022, it was reported that they had split after almost six years of dating.</p><p id=epFW3vAnDDDr data-wc=36>Matt was previously married to American model Melissa McKnight from 2003 until 2006, and they share a 19-year-old daughter together, Marina. Matt is also a stepfather to Melissa's children, Tyler and Jacquelyn, from her previous marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/200fe03146cd-matt-le-blanc-and-ex-wife-melissa.jpg><p id=eHEZz3o6UZAA data-wc=61>Matt once revealed how his daughter received a goodnight kiss from Prince Harry! Matt told Ellen: "I was filming in London for Top Gear and James Burrows was in town – the director who directed the first episode of Friends. He had tickets to see [Bruce] Springsteen at Wembley Stadium – who he's friends with, so he invited me to go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3cda8f7a8039-matt-leblanc-and-aurora.jpg><p id=eZzEwzCknvNL data-wc=60>"Since my daughter and stepdaughter were in town, we all went to the gig. We all went backstage then into the hospitality suite to meet Bruce - and Prince Harry was there. So at the end of the night, Prince Harry gives my daughter and stepdaughter a kiss goodnight on the cheek - and they were both just so floored."</p><h2>David Schwimmer</h2><p id=e8WhBLOLiPLb data-wc=63>He was the soft-centred palaeontologist on Friends&nbsp;who had an on-off relationship with Jennifer's character, Rachel, but in real life, David Schwimmer is thought to be single. David divorced his wife-of-seven-years Zoe Buckman in 2017 and there's been no news of a new partner in his life. <a class=hm-link href=#>The couple share a daughter Cleo</a>, age 12 who looks very much like her famous father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aad6c6afa970-david-schwimmer-zoe-buckman.jpg><p id=ehaSNYFbBXIH data-wc=38>At the time of their separation, David and Zoe released the following statement: "It is with great love, respect and friendship that we have decided to take some time apart while we determine the future of our relationship.</p><p id=e6ezIGBlxMeT data-wc=41>"Our priority is, of course, our daughter's happiness and wellbeing during this challenging time, and so we ask for your support and respect for our privacy as we continue to raise her together and navigate this new chapter for our family."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx2fJVsZ29nnZqytXnToZxmnqKesq%2Bw0maamqukqHqnrcyio6Kdo2K6osDToZywZaCav7PFjKOcp6aZm7KzecCnoKysn6N6pLvUq6ueppWueqS712akqKqVZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-the-friends-casts-families-matthew-perry-jennifer-aniston-courteney-cox-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-the-friends-casts-families-matthew-perry-jennifer-aniston-courteney-cox-more.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-the-friends-casts-families-matthew-perry-jennifer-aniston-courteney-cox-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-the-friends-casts-families-matthew-perry-jennifer-aniston-courteney-cox-more.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-the-friends-casts-families-matthew-perry-jennifer-aniston-courteney-cox-more.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-the-friends-casts-families-matthew-perry-jennifer-aniston-courteney-cox-more.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nera-quinn-hardy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nera-quinn-hardy.html>Meet Wolfgang Xander Hardy Photos Of Matt Hardys Son With Wife Reby Sky</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./league-of-legends-smolders-release-window-confirmed.html>League of Legends: Smolders release window, confirmed</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./league-of-legends-smolders-release-window-confirmed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
