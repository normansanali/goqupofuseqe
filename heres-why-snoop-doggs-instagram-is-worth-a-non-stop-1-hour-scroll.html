Well, it’s the popular consensus that the side of personality that shows up on Instagram or Social Media is nothing but a form of an overstatement. Although that might be the case with most, Snoop Dogg never pulled blinds on what he thinks should be available for his fans to know and enjoy. And consequently, his Insta is not a bad place to get a glimpse of his multifaceted character – the funny and furious side of Dogg.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dogg’s Instagram profile is a pretty huge page quite like his work resume. Being a frequent poster, Dogg is probably the only pop-top celebrity to have posted around 45.1k times on a recent average of 10-12 posts per day. The number is naturally suggestive that Snoop’s Instagram carries a world of thoughts of different nature for his fans. Humongous page attracts a humongous following, Snoop Dogg has a whopping 46.5M devoted following on Insta.</p><p>The aim of the profile isn't to turn Snoop's fairly private life social as he doesn't post many bits from his personal settings. However, his uncut thoughts come to the surface through posts majorly featuring non-celebrity faces. Speaking of the kind of posts, the great mix of memes, photos, and frequent videos is pretty tempting to have his fans coming back to check out his profile. It's not just great posts but his captions in not so immaculate English seem to cheer us up. For example, Snoop shared a shot from his kitchen captioned, "Brunch with. Da dogg Comin soon. Straight out the cook book. From crook2cook."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People who are chained to scrolling through disgustingly laughable posts are going to love the show Snoop puts up on his profile. After 10 episodes of <a href=#>The Last Dance</a>, Dogg posted a true godly picture of Michael Jordan which wasn't just another ordinary piece of appreciation. The post evidently displays how the documentary struck the rocker.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kate Middleton Just Became A Royal Game-Changer With Her Post: Instagram Vs. Reality</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Celebrities with a top busy schedule hand their social accounts to their PR machinery but Snoop certainly doesn't follow the suit. Although he promotes his projects almost all of his projects on Instagram, its major purpose is to deliver his fans what they look for from Dogg i.e. a great social media time.</p><p>However consistent Snoop might be in posting, the profile is totally uncertain in terms of what going to pop next. Out of nowhere, Dogg may flaunt the home screen of his phone without anything special as you'd expect. The tall man shifts gear in an interesting way, from a funny meme to something totally unseen and unheard of. It can even be in the form of a clip of Dogg beavering away on an addictive tune. In fact, the variety of posts and the element of unexpectedness interestingly turn Dogg's profile into a real surprise box.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, the Snoop Dogg fandom gets an uncut view of their favorite rocker. Dogg isn't afraid to be vocal on the gravest of topics, he talks about almost everything candidly in long-length videos. Consequently, to keep a good track of the latest news on how Snoopy Snoop is doing and what's next, his Instagram is the place to be. The announcements of his latest projects are never late on the profile. The release of his latest song I Wanna Go Outside was announced at the perfect time assuring his 46.5M followers are the first ones to enjoy the ecstasy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last for the best, the main attraction of the Snoop's page is the hilarious set of blunt memes. Undoubtedly, memes are one of the most voguish and sellable stuff present on all social media. And if there is one celebrity who the presses all the juice out of it, it is none other than the fast-talking Snoop Dogg. He does it all, using text, <a href=#>celebrity faces</a>, and even commoners. A few special memes turn Snoop into a different celebrity and others into Snoop. Well, mostly those are pictures but some wild posts of similar kinds are in the form of videos too. How about <a href=#>Mike Tyson</a> and Snoopy Snoop enjoying some girly talks and sharing chuckles? Probably, this is the funniest Mike Tyson has ever been.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All in all, the page is sick in all the possible ways. Thanks to Snoop Dogg, he doesn't leave a single stone unturned to get the laughter out. In all likelihood, at the end of it you are going to say to yourself, 'That's not what I was looking for but it felt nice."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Fake It 'Til You Make It: Top Celeb Tricks For Epic Instagram Photos</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmqqenn6V6pbvGoKpmoZ6owaKz0ZqkZqGjYsSwvtOhZJplnqS7br%2FTqKdmaV2dvLa%2BjKyaq6ecoXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-why-snoop-doggs-instagram-is-worth-a-non-stop-1-hour-scroll.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-why-snoop-doggs-instagram-is-worth-a-non-stop-1-hour-scroll.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-why-snoop-doggs-instagram-is-worth-a-non-stop-1-hour-scroll.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-why-snoop-doggs-instagram-is-worth-a-non-stop-1-hour-scroll.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-why-snoop-doggs-instagram-is-worth-a-non-stop-1-hour-scroll.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-snoop-doggs-instagram-is-worth-a-non-stop-1-hour-scroll.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-old-is-masterchef-junior-contestant-chad-gibbs-information-about-jidion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-old-is-masterchef-junior-contestant-chad-gibbs-information-about-jidion.html>How old is MasterChef Junior contestant Chad Gibbs?
