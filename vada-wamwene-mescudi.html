<time>02 Oct 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi, better known by his stage name Kid Cudi, has a famous daughter named Vada Wamwene. The father of Mescudi is a rapper, singer, and performer. He was widely acknowledged as having influenced a number of modern hip hop and alternative groups.</p><p>Although the general public may perceive Kid Cudi as having a grey nature, he has always made an effort to be the greatest possible father to his children.</p><p>Vada, however, has been somewhat impacted by Cudi’s troubled past; for instance, she frequently had to split her time between two different homes and families. Do you know how much she participates in her father’s musical activities, or does she only live with her mother?</p><h3>What Does Vada Wamwene Mescudi Really Mean?</h3><p>Mescudi was conceived on March 26, 2010. Her name combines Germanic and Kenyan elements; Vada in the former refers to a legendary monarch, while Wamwene in the latter (pronounced Wom Win Aye) indicates a young child who belongs to exceptional people. Mescudi is of African-American and Mexican ancestry, descended from her father.</p><p>The rapper Kid Cudi’s daughter Vada Wamwene Mescudi was born.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tumblr_miv5d179q51rmvj9ao3_500_450x.jpg alt="Vada Wamwene Mescudi,vada wamwene mescudi mother,jacqueline munyasya,vada wamwene mescudi age,vada wamwene mescudi parents,vada wamwene mescudi birthday,vada wamwene mescudi mom,vada wamwene mescudi instagram,vada wamwene mescudi mum,kid cudi vada wamwene mescudi" width=450 height=338 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Elsie Harriet Mescudi (formerly Banks), Vada’s paternal grandmother, teaches choir at Roxboro Middle School in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. Her grandpa, Lindberg Styles Mescudi, served in the Air Force during World War II and was a house painter and substitute teacher.</p><h3>One Of Vada Wamwene Mescudi’s Father Shoes Is Named After Her</h3><p>Adidas and Mescudi’s father, Cudi, collaborated to release sneakers with a space motif in December 2020. A beautiful ode to Vada is paid by the footwear with the name Vadawam 326.</p><p>Vada Wamwene Mescudi, Cudi’s daughter, has an adidas sneaker bearing her name.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Capture_1_450x-9.jpg alt="Vada Wamwene Mescudi,vada wamwene mescudi mother,jacqueline munyasya,vada wamwene mescudi age,vada wamwene mescudi parents,vada wamwene mescudi birthday,vada wamwene mescudi mom,vada wamwene mescudi instagram,vada wamwene mescudi mum,kid cudi vada wamwene mescudi" width=450 height=492 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Each Vadawam shoe bears the number 326, which the rapper from Pursuit of Happiness also had tattooed on his neck. The numbers are probably Wamwene’s birthdate, which is March 26. The 90s high top shoes have smooth leather uppers with ornamental edge bands. Additionally, a torsion bar in the midsole provides stability. The sneakers were initially available in two colorways: white/ecru tint/yellow and black/grey/solar pink.</p><h3>Vada Wamwene Mescudi’s Father Lost Her Custody</h3><p>The heated custody dispute between Mescudi’s father, Cudi, and his baby mom ended in defeat in court in September 2016. Scott consented to give the mother of the child sole custody of the child. After a year of fighting for joint custody, he gave in.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Capture_4_450x-9.jpg alt="Vada Wamwene Mescudi,vada wamwene mescudi mother,jacqueline munyasya,vada wamwene mescudi age,vada wamwene mescudi parents,vada wamwene mescudi birthday,vada wamwene mescudi mom,vada wamwene mescudi instagram,vada wamwene mescudi mum,kid cudi vada wamwene mescudi" width=450 height=297 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>According to Cudi, he purchased a home in Chicago to be near the two-year-old. and even generously supported her mother financially. Jacqueline Munyasya, Cudi’s ex-girlfriend, said in documents obtained by TMZ that he only provided her “sporadic and inconsistent amounts” of cash. Mescudi’s mother also charged the rapper of being a non-parental figure. She also bemoaned Cudi’s propensity for violence and his “long history of continuous drug and alcohol misuse.”</p><p>In the end, the two parties reached a settlement, and Vada’s mother now has complete custody. Contrarily, Cudi was given visitation privileges and was required to pay child support. The fact that Mescudi’s father allegedly sent his baby mama 168 threatening texts over the course of four days was another factor in his loss of custody.</p><p>Even odd, one of the texts stated, “Hanging with a lot of White People is not What I Want Either.”</p><h3>Vada Wamwene Mescudi’s Father Kid Cudi Struggled With Drug Addiction And Mental Health</h3><p>Cudi, Vada’s father, has previously struggled with mental illness. He admitted in an interview that his psychological well-being had deteriorated due to his celebrity, unmet fan expectations, and the music business.</p><p>Additionally, Mescudi’s father acknowledged that he had used cocaine to deal with “emotional breakdowns,” primarily as a result of failing in multiple romantic relationships. Nevertheless, Cudi has been drug-free since 2016 and is currently so.</p><p>Additionally, Scott issued an apology to his previous partners for mistreating them in 2019.</p><h3>Vada’s Father, Kid Cudi Relationship History; Does Mescudi Have Any Siblings From Those Affairs?</h3><p>In 2009, when Cudi began dating entertainment attorney Jamie Baratta, people began to take a strong interest in his personal life. But in the years that followed, their relationship was turbulent. The two, however, broke ways in 2012. Mescudi’s rapper father even wrote the song “Teleport 2 Me, Jamie” for his alternative rock album “WZRD” when things were good between the two.</p><p>Following that, the Indicud Singer began an affair with Stella Maeve, an actress well known for her role in Syfy’s The Magicians. While the couple never talked openly about the relationship, they were pretty close at the 2012 premiere of Red 2.</p><p>The Frequency singer’s mother, Jacqueline Munyasya, was the one who eventually introduced romance into his life. This was the first love relationship that Kid had that resulted in his having a family, and it seemed to be “it” among all the other partners he had dated. However, Munsaya and Cudi’s romance eventually came to an end, and they split up in the middle of the decade.</p><p>The former third-place Billboard hitter started dating actress and costume designer Raquel Deriane after Vada’s mother. Even Cudi’s “Man on the Moon III: The Chosen” was influenced by the connection.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/w.jpg alt="Vada Wamwene Mescudi,vada wamwene mescudi mother,jacqueline munyasya,vada wamwene mescudi age,vada wamwene mescudi parents,vada wamwene mescudi birthday,vada wamwene mescudi mom,vada wamwene mescudi instagram,vada wamwene mescudi mum,kid cudi vada wamwene mescudi" width=450 height=241 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Although, given that it has been a while since they have last been seen together, it is unclear if they are actually dating or if they are simply a dreamy public couple.</p><h3>Vada Wamwene Mescudi’s Father Bought A $7.7million Mansion! Is This To Win The Custody Of His Daughter?</h3><p>Mescudi’s father paid a staggering $7.7 million in July 2021 to buy an 11.5-acre mansion in a quiet gated community in Calabasas, California. The property is located in a rapidly populating and affluent area on the western fringe of the expansive San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles.</p><p>The 9,000 square foot, mostly Mediterranean-style mansion has eight bathrooms and six bedrooms. While everything is great and demonstrates Cudi’s excellent financial standing, some people think the property purchase may have been a ruse to gain custody of his kid. Furthermore, there haven’t been many updates regarding the level of guardianship Cudi has over Vada since he lost the legal battle in 2016.</p><p>The All In rapper, though, is said to not have that much trouble gaining contact to his now 11-year-old daughter, especially given how at ease he may be considering his $16 million net worth.</p><h3>Vada Wamwene Mescudi Promoted Eminem And Her Father’s Collab</h3><p>The alliance between Cudi and Slim Shady was originally announced by Mescudi, Cudi’s daughter, in July 2020. Vada took control of her father’s Twitter account a few days before to the premiere of The Adventures of Moon Man & Slim Shady and said, “Hi! The Adventures of Moon Man and Slim Shady, the new single from my father, will be out on Friday, I’m Vada. Look it up! ”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>And now a word from Princess Vada the chosen… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xmgIMkUntz</a></p><p>— The Chosen One (@KiDCuDi) <a href=#>July 8, 2020</a></p><p>Earlier, Cudi posted an ambiguous tweet in which he begged “rap God” Eminem for assistance.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="Vada Wamwene Mescudi,vada wamwene mescudi mother,jacqueline munyasya,vada wamwene mescudi age,vada wamwene mescudi parents,vada wamwene mescudi birthday,vada wamwene mescudi mom,vada wamwene mescudi instagram,vada wamwene mescudi mum,kid cudi vada wamwene mescudi" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
