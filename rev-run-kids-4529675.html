The rapper’s eldest boy, nicknamed&nbsp;<strong>Jojo</strong>, has also appeared on&nbsp;Run’s House albeit in only 14 episodes. He’s also <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>made appearances</a> on&nbsp;Growing Up Hip Hop, and he’s taken on a few acting roles, most notably as Drew in both&nbsp;King of Newark films. In 2016, Jojo’s now-wife gave birth to his first daughter&nbsp;<strong>Mia.&nbsp;</strong>“I had a lot of troubles, but me having a child matured me in a crazy way. It made me look at life way differently and just made me way more focused on things,” he told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2018 interview</a>. Jojo married his wife&nbsp;<strong>Tanice Amira&nbsp;</strong>in 2019, having been together since 2010, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.</p><h2><strong>Daniel Dwayne Simmons III</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Run’s second son and oldest child with Justine&nbsp;<strong>Daniel Dwayne,&nbsp;</strong>30, was born in March 1991.

Just like Daniel, Russell (also known as Russy) was named after Run’s older brother, music icon&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Russell Simmons.</strong></a> Like his other siblings, Russell appeared on&nbsp;Run’s House,&nbsp;but he also starred in some of his dad’s other reality shows, like&nbsp;Rev Runs Around The World, which he was the host of, via<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> IMDb</a>. When his son turned 25, Run made a sweet Instagram post to show how proud he was. “HERE’S NO WAY YOU’RE 25 TODAY HAPPY BDAY RUSSY,” he wrote at the time.</p><h2><strong>Miley Justine Simmons</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Not much is known about Run’s youngest daughter&nbsp;<strong>Miley,&nbsp;</strong>14, who was born in 2007. The little girl was adopted years after the loss of Run’s youngest daughter. Miley’s adoption came up in season four of Run’s House,&nbsp;and since then, she’s appeared in other series alongside her dad like&nbsp;Rev Runs Around The World, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Essence</a>.</p><h2><strong>Victoria Anne Simmons</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Justine and Run’s youngest daughter was a heartbreaking story. Justine gave birth to&nbsp;<strong>Victoria&nbsp;</strong>in September 2006. She tragically suffered from a birth defect called omphalocele, which causes a child’s internal organs to grow outside of their body during pregnancy, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>.</a> Justine gave birth via C-section and Victoria sadly didn’t make it. Justine opened up about her daughter’s death in the couple’s book&nbsp;Old School Love in 2020. “I had carried Victoria Anne full-term; she was in me, a part of me. I could feel her every single day in me,” she wrote, via<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;People</a>. “Joey found comfort in God and being with me. I found comfort going under the covers. For the most part, on most days, I was trying to heal my body, heal my sadness, heal my sorrow, and heal my heart … I was lonely for my child.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9GerWaqpaN6rLXDrGRtbWJug3iBjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frev-run-kids-4529675.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frev-run-kids-4529675.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frev-run-kids-4529675.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frev-run-kids-4529675.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frev-run-kids-4529675.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frev-run-kids-4529675.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./women-of-the-civil-war.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./women-of-the-civil-war.html>How The Women Of The Civil War Helped Shape American History</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mary-kay-adelman.html>Did Rick Adelmans Son David Adelman Follow His Footsteps?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mary-kay-adelman.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
