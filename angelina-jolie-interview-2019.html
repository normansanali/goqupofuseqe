Jolie has spent nearly 20 years with the UN Refugee Agency fighting for the rights and freedoms of displaced people, and over 10 years funding schools for girls from Afghanistan to Kenya to Cambodia. She is a Visiting Professor in Practice at the London School of Economics, educating students on peace and security and the fight for women’s rights internationally. She champions women’s health—in particular, treatment for cancer—with honesty and openness about her own health experiences in years past.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here, she writes candidly about “visible and invisible scars,” her fight for freedom around the world, and why she doesn’t mind sharing her new home in Cambodia with a family of chipmunks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HARPER'S BAZAAR:</strong> <strong>We recognize in these photos the free-spirited, bold side of you we know from old. Is that a fair characterization?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ANGELINA JOLIE: </strong>My body has been through a lot over the past decade, particularly the past four years, and I have both the visible and invisible scars to show for it. The invisible ones are harder to wrestle with. Life takes many turns. Sometimes you get hurt, you see those you love in pain, and you can’t be as free and open as your spirit desires. It’s not new or old, but I do feel the blood returning to my body.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Do you feel like you’re finding yourself again?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>AJ: </strong>The part of us that is free, wild, open, curious can get shut down by life. By pain or by harm. My children know my true self, and they have helped me to find it again and to embrace it. They have been through a lot. I learn from their strength. As parents, we encourage our kids to embrace all that they are, and all that they know in their hearts to be right, and they look back at us and want the same for us.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>As a mother of six, in a world of social media on a public stage, under relentless scrutiny, how do you teach your kids to be bold?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>AJ: </strong>Knowing our true self is a very important question for all of us. Especially a child. I think kids need to be able to say, “Here’s who I am, and what I believe.” We can’t prevent them from experiencing pain, heartache, physical pain, and loss. But we can teach them to live better through it.</p><img alt="Veil, Bridal veil, Beauty, Magazine, Bridal accessory, Bride, Photography, Fashion accessory, Flesh, " title="Veil, Bridal veil, Beauty, Magazine, Bridal accessory, Bride, Photography, Fashion accessory, Flesh, " width=2662 height=3263 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-december-2019-angelina-jolie-07-1572496879.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Sølve Sundsbø</span><p>Veil of perception.

What do you think is the biggest misconception about you?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>AJ: </strong>I have a tattoo, “A prayer for the wild at heart kept in cages.” I got it when I was 20. I was with my mom one evening, and I was feeling lost. I was restless—always. I still am. We were driving to dinner, and she talked about spending time with Tennessee Williams and how much she loved his words. She told me he wrote that, about the wild at heart. We drove to a tattoo parlor, and I got it inked on my left arm. What she did for me that night was to remind me that the wild within me is alright and a part of me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I see so much beauty in other people. Not when they are pretending to be something other than their true selves. Not when they are harming others. Not when they lie. But the wild ones. The emotional, open, searching ones, longing to be free. The honest ones. Because anything else is a cage impossible to live in.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Difference and diversity are what I value most—in my family and in others. <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>This is our end-of-year edition. Looking ahead to 2020, do you have a message for our readers?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>AJ: </strong>My dream for everyone in 2020 is to remember who they are and to be who they are regardless of what might be disrupting their ability to be free. If you feel you are not living your life fully, try to identify what it is or who it is that is blocking you from breathing. Identify and fight past whatever is oppressing you. That takes many forms, and it is going to be a different fight for everyone. I say this with a deep understanding that for so many women, freedom is simply not an option. Their own system, community, family, government works against them and is part of what is shutting them down. I’m reading the book <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/No-Visible-Bruises-Domestic-Violence/dp/1635570972 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="No Visible Bruises" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">No Visible Bruises</a>, which points out that between 2000 and 2006 more American women died from domestic homicide than American soldiers died on the battlefield. It is shocking that across the world the most dangerous place for women today is the home. There are still more than a dozen countries where violence against a wife or family member is legal. And more than 10 countries where perpetrators of rape can still escape prosecution if they marry the victim. And there are more than 70 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, including nearly 26 million refugees. None of this is just “the way the world is.” It is something monstrously out of balance. And our response can’t be to shrug or to think only about our own countries, because we are all connected. This is a time to fight. If there is a fight in this life, it must be for freedoms and rights. And if we have our freedom, we must fight for others who don’t.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Sounds rebellious</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>AJ: </strong>If nobody ever rebelled, nothing would ever change.</p><img alt="Hair, Face, Blond, Eyebrow, Lip, Hairstyle, Chin, Hair coloring, Beauty, Layered hair, " title="Hair, Face, Blond, Eyebrow, Lip, Hairstyle, Chin, Hair coloring, Beauty, Layered hair, " width=3427 height=4096 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-december-2019-angelina-jolie-01-1572496712.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Sølve Sundsbø</span><p>Change agent.

And for many women it is impossible because of what they are up against. I am conscious every day that I have the freedom to speak openly and to make my own choices. And the ability to encourage my children to explore the world, including the world of ideas and expression, without there being limits to what they are allowed to study or know or imagine themselves doing in the future. I think we all know boldness when we see it. Nothing makes me smile more than when I see someone being fully themselves, with their own individual style and character, whatever that is.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>How did you like to dress when you were younger?</strong><br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>AJ: </strong>At school I wasn’t that popular person; I was a punk. I loved leather, PVC, and fishnets. Those were my three favorite fabrics in my early 20s. I remember the first time I wore PVC pants. I was waiting for an audition, sitting in the sun in L.A. By the time it was my turn, my pants had fused together. I didn’t get the part. But I loved those pants. I wore something similar when I married Jonny [Lee Miller].</p><img alt="Red, Arm, Beauty, Veil, Hand, Leg, Shoulder, Joint, Dress, Outerwear, " title="Red, Arm, Beauty, Veil, Hand, Leg, Shoulder, Joint, Dress, Outerwear, " width=3965 height=4594 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-december-2019-angelina-jolie-04-1572496666.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Sølve Sundsbø</span><p>Dreaming in red.

Difference and diversity are what I value most—in my family and in others. I don’t want to live in a world where everyone is the same, and I imagine that’s true for everyone reading this. I want to meet people I’ve never met before and learn things I don’t know. The challenge today is to embrace our differences. And not to be fooled by efforts to divide us or make us fear others. We’re seeing a retreat of values worldwide. Many governments are less willing to stand up for the kinds of values that previous generations fought and died to secure. When governments stand back, people have to lead the way, as they are in different parts of the world.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>If nobody ever rebelled, nothing would ever change.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Have you ever felt restricted in your own life?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>AJ: </strong>I don’t think of myself that way. In my youth, I focused on what I didn’t have. But as I traveled in my early 20s, my awakening was realizing the freedoms I had in comparison to many people around the world. I’d experienced a childhood free of war. And since then I’ve had the freedom to build my family, to create art, and to play the characters I have. It’s one of the reasons I’ve invested in schools for girls in different countries. To see anyone—but especially a young girl with so much potential—denied their freedom is infuriating to me. I don’t think we will be living in a new era for women’s rights until there has been progress. Until people who’ve raped and abused women and girls in Syria and Myanmar and the DRC, for example, are held accountable. That’s why the focus for the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative is to push for an international accountability mechanism, a body that would allow us to overcome the barriers to justice so prosecutions happen.</p><img alt="Angelina Jolie Harper's Bazaar " title="Angelina Jolie Harper's Bazaar " width=2610 height=3219 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-december-2019-angelina-jolie-05-1572496755.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Sølve Sundsbø</span><p>Pucker up.

When I first went to Cambodia, I thought people would be hardened by having experienced so much war and suffering. But in fact it was the opposite. I found them to be full of grace and fight and life. It’s a home and a headquarters for my foundation. There were physical challenges, though. We had to clear nearly 50 land mines before we could live there.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>You have traveled the world as both an actor and a United Nations special envoy.

I often ask people, “What is it you’ve always wanted to do?” Ninety percent of the time it is an attainable goal and something they admit they could have already done. I think the challenge is to ask yourself what you’ve always wanted to do, and do it. Don’t just be comfortable with what is generally accepted, but find the new. Find your oxygen, your originality, your own voice. Live more fully. Rebel. Resist. Question. Be curious. Explore. Go outside what is comfortable to you. Say the thing you’ve been afraid to say.
