Evan is heterosexual, despite portraying a guy who is exploring his sexuality in the Gossip Girl series. In the 2021 Drama series, he portrays Akeno “Aki” Menzies, a bisexual private school student who enjoys skating and movies.&nbsp;Obie’s (Eli Brown) closest buddy is Aki, and Audrey’s (Emily Alyn Lind) lover is Max (Thomas Doherty). Evan makes his acting debut in the adolescent Drama television series, which premieres on HBO Max in July 2021. The role for Evan was developed by the show’s creator, Joshua Safran. People often misinterpret his personality and looks, particularly his characteristic pink hair, as evidence of his homosexuality.</p><p><strong>Evan told Mr. Porter</strong> what he learnt about his sexuality through his intimate scenes with his male co-star. Aki and his fiancée (Aubrey) were both interested in the same person, Max, and they formed a trio. Evan thought it was strange to kiss a guy and attributed it to “social norms and all that.”&nbsp;Furthermore, he said that his character is bisexual, despite the fact that he is not homosexual in real life. Another challenge was to kiss Thomas Doherty, my co-star in the film.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-evan-mocks-girlfriend-relationship-timeline></span>Who Is Evan Mock’s Girlfriend? Relationship Timeline<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Evan Mock</strong> said in a 2021 interview with Mr. Porter Magazine that he had been seeing his girlfriend, Gray Sorrenti, for almost a year. She is said to be a photographer and a member of the Manhattan elite.&nbsp;The pair resides in New York. However, since he is incredibly secretive, he refuses to provide any other information about his partner or relationship. In the love area, though, things have not always gone well for him.&nbsp;He previously told Monster Children that if he could alter one thing about his life, it would be to remove the memory of being cheated on.</p><p>He said that he would want to forget about his high school sweetheart cheating on him with his “so-called friend.” “People think that’s healthy to experience [a heartbreak] at least once in your life, but I’m calling bullshit on that,” Evan said.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=evan-mocks-parents-and-family></span>Evan Mock’s Parents And Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Evan Mock</strong> was born at Waimea Bay on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. He is of mixed nationality and ethnicity due to his American father and Filipino mother.&nbsp;His father, Steve Mock, is a surfboard fin builder, and his mother, Melissa Mock, is a stay-at-home mom. Evan is the family’s middle child, with an older sister, Alana Spencer, and a younger brother.</p><p>He was born on April 8, 1997, and his zodiac sign is Aries. Evan was homeschooled as a child and hoped to be a professional surfer or skater. After growing up in Hawaii, he moved to California at the age of 18 to pursue a professional skateboarding career. He rose to prominence when musician Frank Ocean shared a video of him skateboarding. Evan walked at fashion shows for labels such as 1017 Alyx 9SM and Louis Vuitton before launching his own clothing line, Sorry in Advance, in 2019.&nbsp;He has also collaborated with Aldo Group, Paco Rabanne, and Giuseppe Zanotti, and in June 2021, he will unveil a line with RVCA.&nbsp;Evan currently lives in both his homeland of Oahu and New York City.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ2mlrtuuc6comafmae5p77InqWdZZmoeqmxjJ2YraGenHqiutiopZ5lmah6qbGMoJiyZaOaxbaty6KrsmWRo7FuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevan-mock-girlfriend-is-he-dating-anyone-is-he-gay-sexuality-and-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fevan-mock-girlfriend-is-he-dating-anyone-is-he-gay-sexuality-and-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fevan-mock-girlfriend-is-he-dating-anyone-is-he-gay-sexuality-and-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fevan-mock-girlfriend-is-he-dating-anyone-is-he-gay-sexuality-and-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevan-mock-girlfriend-is-he-dating-anyone-is-he-gay-sexuality-and-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevan-mock-girlfriend-is-he-dating-anyone-is-he-gay-sexuality-and-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./franco-harris-children-meet-franco-dok-harris.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./franco-harris-children-meet-franco-dok-harris.html>Franco Harris children: Meet Franco Dok Harris</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./canyon-grey-felton.html>Canyon Grey Felton - Single, Bio, Career , Age, Net Worth, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./canyon-grey-felton.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
