However, a decade ago, it appears as though things were quite different for Taylor Swift, and the same holds true for Bradley Cooper.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Cooper was enjoying a huge career surge, in large part thanks to <a href=#>his chemistry with Jennifer Lawrence</a>. As we'll reveal in the following, there wasn't anything romantic between the two and in fact, Lawrence tried to set Cooper up with <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong>, according to the rumor mill.</p><p>We'll take a look at exactly what went down between Swift and Cooper, and why the date never took place. We're also going to dive deeper into Cooper relationship with Lawrence, and how fatherhood completely changed his approach to life. Cooper would also answer Howard Stern's question if there was ever anything going on between himself and Swift after Howard made remarks that they would make beautiful looking children.</p><h2 id=bradley-cooper-revealed-his-relationship-with-jennifer-lawrence-was-strictly-professional>Bradley Cooper Revealed His Relationship With Jennifer Lawrence Was Strictly Professional</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar46680063.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bradley Cooper and <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> shared great chemistry on-screen. Fans wondered if there was anything else to their relationship, given that they were frequently cast in roles together. Cooper was quick to turn that down, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">making mention that their relationship wasn't like that.</a></p><p>“It’s due to David O. Russell, that’s what’s happening,” Cooper said of working with Lawrence. “We did Silver Linings Playbook together. We got along great.”</p><p>“It just didn’t happen,” Cooper said about a possible romance with his co-star. “It’s not the way we are together.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon Was Holding Back Tears After Taylor Swift Surprised Him With One Of The Most Emotional Moments On The Tonight Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cooper would go on to reveal that he got in trouble for lying about the reason they would never date. “I said that once on a red carpet just as a diffuse thing,” Cooper recalled. “And then it became a thing because the girl I was seeing [Suki Waterhouse, 23] was as young as she was.”</p><p>The two didn't date and instead, a rumor seems to indicate that Lawrence tried to play the role of matchmaker instead.

Bradley is very wary of dating someone who is a bit of a serial dater like Taylor."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He thinks she's far too young for him and wants to date someone his own age, not 16-years younger because he's ready for something serious. It was a little awkward for Bradley. Jennifer came to him and told him that Taylor was interested in getting together. He had to politely decline, knowing full well that Jennifer and Taylor are friends. It was an ambitious move from Taylor, but she's going to have fixate on someone else as Bradley's just not that into her."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Taylor Lautner Might Be The Only Taylor Swift Ex Who's Not On Her Songwriting Diss List</a></span></p><p>Two years later, Cooper was asked by Howard Stern about the rumor and the actor was quick to turn it down, despite the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stern suggested that the two would have great looking babies.</a></p><p>Cooper said, "It's complete horse-s---," he told the show's host, Howard Stern.
