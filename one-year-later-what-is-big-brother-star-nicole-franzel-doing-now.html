The show suffered from an identity crisis and as it turns out the viewers weren't tuning in either.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Big Brother 23': Sarah Beth Steagall Is Not As Innocent As She Looks</a></span></p><p>Slowly but surely, it developed an identity, and the host <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julie Chen would also get increasingly comfortable in the role</a>.</p><p>The show has a huge fanbase and for the current season, the winning pot has been upped to $750,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A major reason for the show's success has to be the personalities we've seen throughout the years. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Boogie and Dr. Will</a> are two names that instantly come to mind. In more recent years, Nicole Franzel has to be on top of the mountain, especially given the controversy she caused during the All-Star season.</p><p>Game-wise, she came oh so close from taking it home a second time, though she was ousted in the final three by Cody, a move she did not see coming.</p><p>The dust has settled from the moment and Nicole has moved on with her life. We'll take a look at how she's keeping busy these days along with a recent scare she was forced to endure.</p><h2 id=the-39-big-brother-39-all-star-season-was-her-last>The 'Big Brother' All-Star Season Was Her Last</h2><p>It was a dramatic ending to an otherwise predictable season. Fans appreciated the All-Star twist, however, the season lacked big moves, till the finale. Nicole and Cody seemed to be penciled in as the final two, though Cody had different feelings, deciding to take the sure route alongside Enzo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alongside Us Magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole admitted the move crushed her.</a> "I never thought that he would cut me in a million, zillion years. I thought I would cut him first. And he told me when he was walking to the Diary Room. He was bawling and he just said, like, “I don’t want to blindside you.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Proves She’s Still Bitter By Unfollowing Her ‘BB’ Housemates On Instagram</a></span></p><p>"And that’s all he pretty much said. I was just like, “Are you kidding me? Like, don’t even think about doing this.” I was so prepared to sit final two on finale night. No matter which way it went. And so I just look like a fool."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nicole made mention that had it been up to her, she would've brought Cody into the final two and stayed loyal to their deal. Franzel wasn't pleased by the game move and as it turns out, she was also personally hurt. She took to social media and unfollowed her former close friend.</p><p>As far as a return to the show, that won't be taking place, the veteran is done with it. She isn't speaking about the current cast either, getting rid of Twitter altogether, calling it a toxic environment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To her credit, she has moved on in her life for the better.</p><h2 id=starting-a-family>Starting A Family</h2><p>There was chatter during her time in the house pertaining to a wedding, alongside BB alum Victor Arroyo. However, given the pandemic circumstances, Nicole was forced to push her wedding back.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Big Brother’ Stars Christmas Abbott And Memphis Garrett Attend Nicole Franzel’s Wedding</a></span></p><p>The special moment would still take place for the happy couple and in addition, they announced a new member to their family, Victor Arrow Arroyo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole opened up about the special moment</a> via social media. “I didn’t have to go through the labor part at all!” “It was surprisingly short, and I couldn’t feel a thing. The spinal really relaxed me, I thought it was just going to numb me and I’d still be freaking out, but it was all a very calm birth. A very relaxing atmosphere, which I wasn’t expecting.”</p><p>She would further state the recovery process was also on point, "I have been feeling a little bit better every day. It’s amazing how our bodies can recover so quickly! Definitely took a week for me to feel like walking around though. The first couple days, I didn’t want to move much at all.”</p><p>Despite the speedy recovery, she did go through a bit of a scare most recently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=recent-health-scare>Recent Health Scare</h2><p>She was asked on IG most recently how the recovery road was going. According to Franzel, she went through a scare, which resulted in a trip to the ER.</p><p>"I ended up bleeding pretty heavily and thought I was hemorrhaging since I was going through pads so quickly and went to the ER a few days ago."</p><p>Although it was a scary moment, the BB winner is feeling much better these days and enjoying the new chapter in her life.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Big Brother 23': What Fans Think Of Alyssa Lopez's Showmance With Christian Birkenberger</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimp51drrKivoylmK2domLEqa3TZqCsZZKetG6u0airoZ2iYsC1rdFmpaKbn6GybrLRmqWznZxisbC1zaBkp6enZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fone-year-later-what-is-big-brother-star-nicole-franzel-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fone-year-later-what-is-big-brother-star-nicole-franzel-doing-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fone-year-later-what-is-big-brother-star-nicole-franzel-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fone-year-later-what-is-big-brother-star-nicole-franzel-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fone-year-later-what-is-big-brother-star-nicole-franzel-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fone-year-later-what-is-big-brother-star-nicole-franzel-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-did-villalobos-move-from-california-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-did-villalobos-move-from-california-2.html>Why did villalobos move from california</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tiktoker-uncovers-shocking-historical-documentation.html>TikToker uncovers shocking historical documentation</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tiktoker-uncovers-shocking-historical-documentation.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
