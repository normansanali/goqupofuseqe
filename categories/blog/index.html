The engine will need roughly 18-22 ounces of oil to run properly. Most of the time, I will put in 18ounces and then check the dipstick from there and continue to add till the container is full. If your model does not have a dipstick, you may fill the tank with 20 ounces of oil, which should be plenty.

Answer
To begin hearing through walls, get a drinking glass with a broad rim and place it next to your ear. Afterwards, place the rim of the glass on the wall through which you want to listen and lay your ear on the bottom of it. Sound waves will pass through the wall and into the glass, allowing you to hear more clearly through it!
