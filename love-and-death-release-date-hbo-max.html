The limited series is inspired by the book Evidence of Love: A True Story of Passion and Death in the Suburbs as well as a collection of articles from Texas Monthly (Love & Death in Silicon Prairie, Part I & II).</p><p>Candace 'Candy' Lynn Montgomery was 30 at the time of Betty Gore's murder in 1980 in Wylie, Texas. Candy was married to Pat Montgomery and the pair had two children together. Together, they would regularly attend their local Methodist church and there, Candy became friends with Betty, who was a middle school teacher.</p><p>Betty was married to Alan Gore, who was engaged in an affair with Candy and one day when out of town, he was concerned about the welfare of his wife and asked neighbours to enquire if she was at home. When they forced their way into the Gore household, they found Betty's body. She was later found to have been struck 41 times with an axe. Their baby daughter was awake and crying in her cot in the next room.</p><p>Candy was accused of Betty's murder and stood trial, where she stated that she acted in self-defence after an alleged confrontation about her and Alan's affair. She said she used an axe to attack Betty as Betty had used the same weapon on her. Undergoing a polygraph test before the trial, it revealed that she was telling the truth.</p><p>On 30th October 1980, Candy was found not guilty by the jury. The verdict received major criticism from the local community. The story has been adapted for the screen in 1990 movie A Killing in a Small Town, 2022's <a href=# rel=noopener>Candy</a> and now, Love & Death.</p><h2 id=is-there-a-trailer-for-love-death-f4782ff6><strong>Is there a trailer for Love & Death?</strong></h2><p>There is, and it gives a first look at the star-studded cast and the chilling true story.
