<time>10 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=#>Tyrese</a> has remained firm in his stance against ex-wife <a class=underline-link href=#>Samantha Lee, who he claims only married him for his money</a> given the terms of their divorce.</p><p>During a <a href=# rel=noopener>Joe Budden Podcast</a> appearance on Friday (November 24), the actor and singer elaborated on his dramatic split and the ensuing court orders that he insists are unreasonable — one of which includes <a class=underline-link href=#>him being ordered to pay $20,000 a month in child support</a> for their five-year-old daughter.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>In a clip from the interview posted on his Instagram, he said: “We never spent $20,000 on my daughter when we were together, and I had the money. Like, who spends that kind of money on a kid? [My daughter] was one when [Samantha] took my baby from me.</p><p>“We never spent $20,000 a month on our child and the credit card was wide open, so what the fuck do you suddenly need that kind of money for?”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>In a lengthy caption attached to the social media video, the <a class=underline-link href=#>TGT</a> vocalist went into detail about how he’s made several attempts at pushing back against the legal proceedings that he is convicted have been biased against him thus far.</p><p>Check it out below:</p><p><a class=underline-link href=#>Tyrese is currently requesting a new judge in his ongoing divorce case</a>, suggesting that the one currently presiding over it is prejudiced against him. According to a TMZ report last week, he filed a motion in court alleging Judge Kevin M. Farmer abruptly canceled a hearing that would have allowed him to tell his side of the story before having to fork over a $450,000 bond.</p><p>Instead, he was ordered to come up with the six-figure sum in just 10 days. His plan was to use the hearing to explain why he couldn’t pay the money because of the <a class=underline-link href=#>Hollywood strikes</a>.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/10/tyrese-ex-wife-takes-accountability-for-ugly-and-messy-divorce-250x142.jpg alt="Tyrese’s Ex-Wife Takes ‘Accountability’ For ‘Ugly & Messy’ Divorce" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Tyrese’s Ex-Wife Takes ‘Accountability’ For ‘Ugly & Messy’ Divorce</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>October 30, 2023</p></a><p>This isn’t the first time the Fast & Furious actor has taken issue with Judge Farmer. Days before a court hearing earlier this year (the results of which he was trying to appeal with this latest court date), <a class=underline-link href=#>he blasted the judge for being “racist” and accused him of calling his ex-wife a “bitch”</a> in the private chambers of his office. He also accused the judge of illegally sealing the case to cover up his own misconduct.</p><p>“We tried to get him recused, we tried to get him thrown off the bench because of his conduct and his unprofessionalism. And then there were a bunch of things pertaining to the outcome of my case that he did that was literally illegal,” Tyrese said in an Instagram post.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Tyrese and Farmer’s issues date back to last August, when <a class=underline-link href=#>the Fulton County jurist threatened to hold him in contempt of court</a> for arguing with his ex-wife’s lawyer over his earnings. At that hearing, the Transformers&nbsp;star was ordered to pay over $10,000 a month in child support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mirsqqVqLJuv8uapKxlla16uLXFnmRraJtisKm1y51krK2gpbyzwA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftyrese-slams-ex-wife-20k-child-support.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftyrese-slams-ex-wife-20k-child-support.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftyrese-slams-ex-wife-20k-child-support.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftyrese-slams-ex-wife-20k-child-support.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftyrese-slams-ex-wife-20k-child-support.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftyrese-slams-ex-wife-20k-child-support.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./diddy-relationship-with-kim-porter-facts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./diddy-relationship-with-kim-porter-facts.html>What Diddy's Relationship With Kim Porter Was Like</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tom-macdonald-girlfriend.html>Tom Macdonald Girlfriend 2023| Whos Tom Macdonald Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tom-macdonald-girlfriend.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
